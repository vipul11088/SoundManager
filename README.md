SoundManager
============
Sound plays a big and important role in flash, when it comes to gaming because game has to be loaded with sounds, and not only with a single background sound, but with several type of sounds for each activity of the game.
I am going to share a sound manager utility class with you, in whom all the operations related to sound is there like: play, pause, stop, loop play, single sound play at a time, multiple sounds play at a time, sound mute, unmute, transformation (volume up/down).
